I"Ø<p>Wow, itâ€™s my first blog post. 
My plan is to document my IoT project here, and I will update it with new things when I have the spoons to.</p>

<p>Look at the blank slate!

<p>The planned configuration for this project is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM) - running Raspbian OS</li>
  <li>Running an instance of Home Assistant (possibly as a docker image)</li>
  <li>ConBee II Zigbee USB-Gateway</li>
</ul>

<p>Lately I havenâ€™t had the time to set up this IoT project, however, hopefully during the term break I can whip the stuff together.
For now, I have to be careful about what IoT devices I purchase, as my firewall is the default ISP given, which I acknowledge that is EXTREMELY insecure <em>especially</em> when setting up IoT devices. Perhaps my first port of call (lol) is to purchase better networking gear.</p>
