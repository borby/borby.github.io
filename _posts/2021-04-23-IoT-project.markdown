Wow, it's my first blog post. 
My plan is to document my IoT project here, and I will update it with new things when I have the spoons to.

Look at the blank slate!

The planned configuration for this project is:
- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM) - running Raspbian OS
- Running an instance of Home Assistant (possibly as a docker image)
- ConBee II Zigbee USB-Gateway


Lately I haven't had the time to set up this IoT project, however, hopefully during the term break I can whip the stuff together.
For now, I have to be careful about what IoT devices I purchase, as my firewall is the default ISP given, which I acknowledge that is EXTREMELY insecure _especially_ when setting up IoT devices. Perhaps my first port of call (lol) is to purchase better networking gear.
